        <h1>Video #1</h1>
        <h2>2013/4</h2>
        <h3>Brad Frost</h3>

        <p>Brad Frost has a few points he makes his is video “2013/4”. He first points out how much the internet use has gone up just in the past couple years. The rise of technology is there and happening. Facebook, instagram, twitter are having people access and use more of the internet whether is it updating a status or posting a photo. With technology becoming so easily accessible at this point is hard not to sometimes think to how life was when before everything could be found and completed online. This is when Frost gets into what he finds bullshit. I found this part to be very interesting and just to hear what he had to say. For starters, he goes on to say paper is bullshit but why would we write out something by hand when someone is just going to have to type it in the computer later. Advertising, spam mail, updates and the list goes on. I found this video interesting and raised thoughts on the subject that I probably would have not thought about before. Some things I found surprising was that 2.4 billion people have access and are online. Seems like a lot but when thinking about the entire world it isn’t a lot. Also when he said in only the past two-year the amount of photos we take has dramatically increased. Its something you would have thought happen gradually over time. And finally, when he said IBM stated that 90% of data ever created was created in the past two years. </p>

        <h1>Video #2</h1>
        <h2>10 Things I didn't know about HTML</h2>
        <h3>Mathias Bynens</h3>
        <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/89935203">Link to 10 Things I didn't know about HTML</a></p>
        <p>Mathias Bynen’s talk about “10 things I didn’t know about HTML” first was not just strictly based on what he didn’t know about HTML. He also goes into Java Script and CSS. First part of the speech, which I also found really interesting, was the different layers to validations. Just because you codes validates does not mean it ends there and you are now a web developer. The human eye and a person going back to look over can only detect some errors.  What Bynen is trying to explain to the audience it that you cannot always rely on the online validations to check you code. Even for Java and CSS, it is important to still go back over and check over you codes for any errors. Next what I found interesting is when he went on to talk about tags and closing tags. Correct me if I’m wrong but what he was saying is for the beginning of doc type html you don’t always need the body and head tags and just the title. That blew my mind a little since I’m used to always adding them and going strictly by the book when it comes to opening and closing my tags at all times. A lot of what Bynen was discussing in his video felt very similar to what we learn and go over in our Web Design class just with a little more detail but hey detail and extra help is never a bad thing. Lastly what I found interesting in the video was how Bynen discussed more then 10 things he didn’t know. But also since I do not know or have much practice with Java Script. Strings in Java was a little surprising and especially new. How he was saying two characters you code come to form on single character. Different from coding in HTML a bit.  </p>

        <h1>Video #3</h1>
        <h2>Front End Legos: Better Design with Reusable HTML & CSS</h2>
        <h3>Shay Howe</h3>

        <p>Shay Howe starts off his video presentation with talking about how coding at times can seem a little uneasy like on a ship. Coding is fragile and difficult at time, not always expecting the unexpected. A lot has to go into coding to build and create something new. Howe goes on to talk about bad practices to avoid when it comes to code and especially coding CSS. Howe talks about how it is bad to avoid classes. Especially when you have a lot going on in your code you have to be able to tell which is which and what goes with what. I found this useful because I have this problem. Classes, divs and making ids do scare me at time. I never know or have complete trust in putting them in the correct places or if I then code them right. Next, Howe talks about the organizations off your CSS are very important. He organizes his CSS on Base, component, and modules. This I found interest because I never thought about how learning to organize your organizations will help to make things run more smoothly and look great. Howe says he doesn’t want coding CSS to feel like a job and in fact wants it to feel as he is the captain with full control over what he is putting out. I completely agree because the more confortable you get with coding, the easier it is to tackle and have complete control. Lastly what I found interesting goes back to the classes and ids. Naming the classes is crucial and important. You want to make sure the name you give it can’t be found anywhere else on your code and at the same time it is distinct enough. This is useful for people like me, who do fear the classes and ids.  </p>
